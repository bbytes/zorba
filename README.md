Project Zorba
=====

Zorba is an Open Source Runtime Background Job Submission Project. Zorba enables you to register your jobs, and then send requests to run those jobs. Once job execution is completed, it will send you a response back. You can also monitor the job progress using the web interface it provides. 

This project is in its nascent stage and is currently in 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT version.
